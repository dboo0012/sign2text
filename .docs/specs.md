# 1: Project Foundation Setup

Create a basic project structure for a real-time sign language recognition application. Set up:

1. A FastAPI backend with the following structure:

   - main.py with basic FastAPI app initialization
   - requirements.txt with essential dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, python-multipart)
   - A simple health check endpoint at /health that returns {"status": "healthy"}
   - CORS middleware configuration to allow all origins for development

2. A React frontend with:

   - Create React App initialization
   - Basic project structure with src/components, src/services, src/utils folders
   - A simple App.js that displays "Sign Language Recognition System" and a placeholder for the video component
   - Install socket.io-client dependency

3. Add a docker-compose.yml file that:

   - Sets up the FastAPI backend on port 8000
   - Sets up the React frontend on port 3000
   - Includes volume mapping for development

4. Include basic .gitignore files for both Python and Node.js
5. Add README.md with setup instructions

The focus is on getting a basic, runnable foundation where both services start successfully and the React app can make a basic HTTP request to the FastAPI health endpoint.

# 2: WebSocket Connection Foundation

Building on the previous setup, implement basic WebSocket connectivity between the React frontend and FastAPI backend:

1. Backend changes (main.py):

   - Add a WebSocket endpoint at /ws that accepts connections
   - Implement basic connection handling with connect/disconnect logging
   - Add a simple echo functionality that receives messages and sends them back with a timestamp
   - Include error handling for WebSocket disconnections

2. Frontend changes:

   - Create a new component WebSocketManager in src/components/
   - Implement WebSocket connection to the configured server endpoint (see environment constants)
   - Add connection status display (Connected/Disconnected/Connecting)
   - Create a simple test interface with an input field and send button
   - Display received messages from the server
   - Handle connection errors and automatic reconnection attempts

3. Integration:
   - Import and use WebSocketManager in App.js
   - Add basic styling to show connection status clearly
   - Ensure the WebSocket connection is established when the component mounts

The goal is to have a working bidirectional communication channel that can send and receive simple text messages, with clear visual feedback of the connection status.

# 3: Camera Access and Pose Estimation Setup

Extend the application to capture video from the user's camera and implement client-side pose estimation for keypoint extraction:

1. Install pose estimation dependencies:

   - Add @mediapipe/pose or @tensorflow/tfjs and @tensorflow-models/pose-detection to React project
   - Include required model files and configurations

2. Create a new component PoseEstimation in src/components/:

   - Request camera permissions using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()
   - Display the video stream in a video element with overlay canvas for pose visualization
   - Initialize MediaPipe Pose or TensorFlow.js PoseNet model
   - Add proper error handling for camera access denied or model loading failures
   - Include toggle buttons to start/stop camera and enable/disable pose visualization

3. Implement pose detection utilities in src/utils/poseUtils.js:

   - Create function to run pose estimation on video frames
   - Extract keypoint coordinates (x, y, visibility/confidence) for relevant body parts
   - Focus on upper body keypoints essential for sign language: shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers (if available)
   - Implement keypoint smoothing to reduce jitter
   - Add keypoint validation (filter out low-confidence detections)

4. Add pose visualization:

   - Draw skeleton connections between keypoints on overlay canvas
   - Use different colors for high/low confidence keypoints
   - Add toggle to show/hide pose overlay for debugging

5. Backend preparation:

   - Update WebSocket endpoint to handle JSON keypoint data instead of binary image data
   - Create data structure for keypoint frames: {"timestamp": "...", "keypoints": [{"x": 0.5, "y": 0.3, "confidence": 0.9, "name": "left_wrist"}]}
   - Add validation for received keypoint data format

6. Integration:
   - Replace basic video capture with PoseEstimation component
   - Ensure pose detection runs at appropriate frame rate (15-30 FPS)
   - Add performance monitoring for pose estimation processing time
   - Include loading states while pose estimation model initializes

The result should be a working camera feed with real-time pose estimation that extracts and visualizes keypoints, preparing structured data for sign language recognition.

# 4: Keypoint Data Transmission and Processing

Implement keypoint data capture, preprocessing, and transmission to the backend via WebSocket:

1. Frontend keypoint data processing:

   - Modify PoseEstimation component to capture keypoints at regular intervals (15 FPS)
   - Create keypoint normalization function (normalize coordinates relative to body center/scale)
   - Implement temporal smoothing to reduce keypoint jitter across frames
   - Add keypoint sequence buffering (collect sequences of 30-60 frames for sign recognition)
   - Filter and send only relevant keypoints for sign language (hands, arms, face landmarks if available)

2. Create keypoint data structure in src/utils/keypointProcessor.js:

   - Define standard keypoint format compatible with UniSign model expectations
   - Implement keypoint sequence validation (ensure minimum required keypoints are present)
   - Add data compression for efficient transmission (remove redundant/low-confidence points)
   - Create keypoint interpolation for missing frames in sequences

3. WebSocket transmission optimization:

   - Send keypoint sequences as structured JSON data instead of individual frames
   - Implement sequence-based transmission (send complete gesture sequences rather than individual frames)
   - Add sequence metadata: {"sequence_id": "...", "frame_count": 45, "keypoints_sequence": [...], "timestamp_start": "...", "timestamp_end": "..."}
   - Include compression and batching for multiple sequences

4. Backend keypoint handling:

   - Update WebSocket endpoint to process keypoint sequence data
   - Create keypoint validation and preprocessing pipeline
   - Implement keypoint sequence storage and management
   - Add keypoint data logging for debugging and model improvement
   - Return acknowledgment with sequence processing status

5. Add keypoint sequence management:

   - Create frontend sequence buffer that automatically detects gesture boundaries
   - Implement sequence completion detection (pause in movement, return to rest position)
   - Add manual sequence capture controls (start/stop recording gestures)
   - Include sequence preview functionality for user feedback

6. Error handling and fallback:
   - Handle pose estimation failures gracefully
   - Implement fallback to server-side pose estimation if client-side fails
   - Add keypoint quality assessment and user feedback
   - Include network resilience for keypoint data transmission

The outcome should be a system that captures pose keypoints, processes them into structured sequences, and transmits them efficiently to the backend for sign language recognition.

# 5: Mock Sign Recognition with Keypoint Sequences
